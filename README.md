# thotbot
Simple premise, over-complicated code. Many regrets were had developing this.

- Watches a configurable set of words per guild
- Keeps a ranking for users, fostering competition among probably the most offensive members!
- Yeah that's about it

Attempts to try out some new coding paradigms and technologies, the stars being:
- GRPC to efficiently talk between the bot and the backend.
- A NoSQL DB, Mongo
- An attempt at following Microsoft's suggested "Clean Architecture", with most of the SOLID principles in the Api layer.

## Commands (prefixed with !thot.)
- "words add",
- "words list"
- "words remove"
- "words reset"
- "top (user)"
